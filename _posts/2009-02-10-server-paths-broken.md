Because of a broken alias the path [`/ubuntu/dists/intrepid/`] was not
available and resulted in a <code>404</code> error. This has been fixed now.

## Update

The path [`/ubuntu/pool/`] should also work (again) now. Thanks to Peter M. for
the information.

[`/ubuntu/dists/intrepid/`]: http://ubuntu.wgdd.de/ubuntu/dists/intrepid/
[`/ubuntu/pool/`]: http://ubuntu.wgdd.de/ubuntu/pool/
