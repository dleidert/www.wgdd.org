I'm back from the conference at Berlin [Faktor X - Tag der natÃ¼rlichen
Ressourcen][UBA], a side-conference of the [World Resources Forum][WRF] 2009 in
Davos.

[UBA]: https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/themen/abfall-ressourcen/ressourcenschonung-in-produktion-konsum/faktor-x
[WRF]: https://www.wrforum.org/

It was pretty interesting, although the topic is not new. If you don't know it:
We are running out of (several) resources. The main topics going through the
media are often *energy* and *oil*. Well, several metals will become much more
problematic much more earlier! So, what is the aim: material-, product- and
production-efficiency and recycling/upcycling(/downcycling).

One of the topics mentioned at the conference was the IT industry. One of the
keywords is **green IT** - more efficiency through IT, more efficiency by more
efficient hardware, better recycling of hardware, .... Another point was *more
efficiency by more efficient software*. One of the questions mentioned was

> How much resources costs a click at google?

I think, one can adapt this question to almost every software. We have several
software, which is widely used. I'll just mention the apache web-server.
Would't it be good to know, that this widely used software won't waste CPU
cycles for nothing?

So what about a GSoC project checking such often/widely used software for
efficiency (besides checking for buffer or heap overflows or NULL pointer
dereferences)? Can anybody imagine such a project? What is your opinion?
