I now [provide] small snippets to download into the `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/`
directory so you don't have to edit `/etc/apt/sources.list` directly. The
necessary commands are [described here]. Every snippet is limited to one
release. So if you want to have the entries for more than one release (e.g.
<code>Sid+Experimental</code>) you have to download several files.
