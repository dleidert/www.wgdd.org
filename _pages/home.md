    ## New Location, new design
    
    I decided to move away from the [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com) because
    they don't provide a (meaningful) data protection information, and decided
    to get my sites back onto my server. The old domain contained content both
    in English and German. So the latter one was left there and I created this
    new domain to supply content mainly about Debian GNU/Linux and free
    software in English.
