Over the years I've joined some projects, contributed, and (hopefully) left my
mark too. Some of these projects played a big role in my life for quite some
time, like [Bluefish], and I [packaged] many of them for Debian. But even if
everything is about Open Source Software (OSS) it is not just about Linux.
I'm a Windows user too and I contributed there too.
